# Information-Retrival_TP
Building an efficient Vector Space Retrieval system based on text.  
1.Implementing VSM model (TF-IDF weighting, cosine ranking);  
2.Implementation of speed-ups methods (tiered index, pre-clustering, random proj.);  
3.Evaluation of all VSM variants in terms of both retrieval performance and efficiency.
